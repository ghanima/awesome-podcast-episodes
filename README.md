# Awesome Podcast Episodes [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This is a curated list of some of the most informational and helpful podcast episodes I have listened to as a developer. The goal of this list is to provide a good place for developers to find a podcast episode on a particular topic of their interest instead of checking out a long list of episodes on individual podcasts.

This list contains podcast episodes for beginners as well advanced developers. It also has episodes about salary negotiations, work-life balance and other, day to day topics of developer life.

If you want to get a list of all the available podcast shows out there, you can find them [here](https://github.com/guipdutra/awesome-geek-podcasts). For more awesomeness, check out [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
